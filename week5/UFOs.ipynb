       "  'description': 'Small, high-altitude reflective object moving steadily to the south over Santa Cruz, CA.I am a 24 year old waiter and substitute teacher living in Santa Cruz, California.  At approximately 12:05 in the afternoon I went to the curb to take out the garbage.  I heard the sound of an airplane overhead, and I looked up to spot the airplane as I often do.  I saw the airplane travelling along the usual course that I see airliners take, but before I got back to the task of taking out the trash I spotted a strange, small bright light in the sky.  The light was about 45 degrees from the horizon in the northwest corner of the sky.  At first the light looked stationary like a star, but then I perceived it slowly moving towards me to the east.  The object moved very slowly, almost imperceptively.  As I continued to watch the object, it became clear to me that it was moving to the south.  At this point, the object seemed to start moving slightly more rapidly, but that could have just been my perception.  The object seemed very far away and appeared to reflect light much like a star or a satellite.  The object appeared to be circular to me.  About five minutes into this encounter I ran inside to get my phone and called my neighbor who was out running errands.  As I talked to him I continued to watch the object travel south at a steady pace.  Approximately ten minutes into the encounter my neighbor came home and I pointed out the object to him.  He admitted that he found it strange.  He suggested that it was a balloon, but a balloon would not reflect light like that.  Could I have perhaps seen the space station in orbit? This is not the first strange encounter I have had with unidentified objects in the sky.  Please contact me if you can provide any explanation.((NUFORC Note:  The ISS is not visible during daylight hours, under most circumstances,  and it certainly is not visible from the ground for 15 minutes.

These planes are usually travelling in a northerly direction, heading for San Jose airport.However the object I watched was travelling extremely fast and made no sound. It moved in an exactly straight line from east to west. To help describe the speed, imagine lying on your back with your feet pointing south, hands pointing out and the sky above is one half of a clock face: your left hand is east and also 12 o&apos;clock; the right hand is west and 6 o&apos;clock. I spotted the object at around 1 o&apos;clock and watched it travel until 5 o&apos;clock in less than 5 seconds.As the object moved it was completely silent and left no trails. It appeared to go through brightness changes, as if light was being internally reflected off the inside of a sphere. The brightness changes were as linear as the object&apos;s motion.I have watched many planes over the skies here and this was not a plane (well, not a normal one anyway).',\n",

       "  'description': 'Organized human-alien abductionIm not sure if this is the correct place to explain what happened to me when i was ten years old back in the mid seventies..but it wont hurt to tell my story. It was a week of my life that kinda haunts me to this day. I havent discussed this to anyone before..because..it does sound kinda crazy..but the older i have become and the more ive learned about alien life forms..the more creepier i felt about what happened to me back then. Ill start off first by stating what i believe...I believe through my learning and hearing about how aliens basically make their own humans..by impregnating women....in lack of better terminology..using humans..human Dna whatever..they have the technology..like we almost do..to make their own humans. Who knows....that couldhave been the way Mary got impregnated with Jesus....CRAZY? Yeah some people think so..but ???  Anyways...i was ten or eleven years old and i signed up for this soccer camp one summer. The soccer camp was more than a soccer camp..cause it bused all the kids who joined way up into the mountains to camp and play soccer and fish etc...It was alot of fun. West Valley Soccer camp was the name of the &quot;oganization&quot;.A couple of really weird things happened to me that week...and at the time i just shrugged them off, and didnt pay to much thought to any of it....but the events are still with me today more than ever..and im 37 years old now.Now this could be just innocent weird things that happened that have nothing at all to do with other life forms..but who knows maybe someone else might have had something like this happen to them too.   Well..all the kids in the camp slept in bunk beds in lil cabins.  One morning,,all the kids awoke..and wheni woke up..from the top bunk..immedaitely the kids that in the cabin strting asking me what happened to me that night. Did i fall out of the bunk?? Why did they see a couple of the older counselers carrying me and putting me back in bunk in the middle of the night???  Now i had no recollection or memory of any of this happening to me.  That in itself is really bizarrre because..if i would have fallen out of bed i would have remembered.  Well..one more event took place...they had a big 7 mile hike they called it..where the counselours and kids would all hike somewhere for 7 miles and camp out for the night and the next day hike back. Well yeah..it waqs at least 7 miles..and when we came to the place where everyone was going to camp for the night...it was a public lil campground or something  but the oddest thing that didnt trip me out then but does now..was that all over this lil camp ground..posted on the trees...and taped to the port a pottys..was these papers stating that campers should be aware of some kind of bubonic plague or something that was out of control in the wild animal population in the area.  Were these signs there..to scare away people and make this area ideal for the &quot;Soccer camp counselors&quot;?. I dont know...but i do know one thing.,..i woke up in the middle of the night..a hundred yards away from the other campers who were asleep...just .. i guess&quot;walking in my sleep&quot;???? In that week two things happened to me that never before or after happened to me ...it was just all too weird.',\n",

It was silent and fast, really fast. It was clear or see-through (&quot;cloaked&quot;?). But, you could clearly see the shape of the triangle because 3 dim lights outlined it.

The lights maintained their position relative to each other, but I couldn&apos;t see whether they were part of the same craft.  One light was behind and to the left of the other;  if one imagines a triangle moving point-first with lights on the leading point and on the leftmost point behind, with no light on the right, then one can get an idea of what I saw. The lights had an orange color similar to that of a sodium street lamp.  The sky was slightly hazy, and the haze appeared to be at a very high altitude, since a commercial jet observed a moment later appeared very clearly.  The lights of the unidentified object, on the other hand, looked as if they were above the haze.  No sound could be heard, though I listened for a long time (since the sound of fast-moving aircraft can seem to lag behind the image).

It was almost gliding.  There were no markings on the plane at all.  Zero....nothing on the tail or under wings.  I had a viewing angle from side...then I quickly ran to see it going away  I have basically assumed this was a sample of Military spy craft...as Lockheed has a development above the University.If flying at night...and or painted black.....this craft could fly overhead of people or areas with very very little notice.I am sure I saw this.....and lean towards earthly device...but would be classified.

I heard a low roaring sound like a jet and instinctly looked up toward the east for the plane, while I listened to my granddaughter ramble.  I saw a metallic flash through the tree branches and thought &quot;there&apos;s the plane&quot;.  But then, I saw several other metallic flashes and I stepped out into the open looking up.  There was a configuration of 10-12 metallic-type balls.  At first I thought they were balloons, but that didn&apos;t make sense.  Then I thought they must be birds which also made no sense.  The sky was clear blue but was surrounded by heavy clouds to the east over the Santa Cruz mountains.  I watched as they seem to &quot;float&quot; across the sky and I kept trying to figure out what they were.  There were no fins, appendages or moving parts.  They were perfectly spherical and silver.  Then I realized they were flying in a formation of several groups of three to four in each group.  The center group consisted of three.  They seemed perfectly spaced.  Suddenly, the left sphere in the lead group instantly &quot;dipped&quot; towards the lead sphere and then darted back into its previous location.  I watched them move from northeast to southwest heading towards the Monterey Bay.  I called the newspaper to find out if anyone else had reported seeing spheres in the sky flying in formation. They told me no.  I live approximately four blocks from West Cliff Drive in Santa Cruz City.  The weather had cleared, the sun had been shining for a couple of hours and so I know there had to be lots of people jogging, surfing and walking their dogs.  I can&apos;t believe I am the only one who witnessed this phenomena.  I talked to my husband, who has a Ph.d in quantum physics and chemistry.  He suggested balloons..maybe someone let a bunch of balloons go at the same time---but as I told him  &quot;  Since when do balloons fly in formation?&quot;  I used to work on the original F/A-18 program at Patuxent Naval Air Station.  I know a little something about aircraft.  These were no aircraft and were definitely metal or metallic.  They were so bright with the sun shining on them.

It was so dramatic that a car stopped and 4 people jumped out to look at it.Now I realize that this could have been a firework but it would have to have been an industrial/military type thing because these lights were really high in the sky.  There is no mention of it in the news so far.',\n",

Then one slowed down and went in a different direction and the other three that were visable slowed down and moved apart slightly.  They changed directions towards the one that left and then they all came back together in an easterly direction and then there appeared to be six of them flying very close together, almost touching.  They continued going north-east until we couldn&apos;t see them anymore.  The strange thing was that they changed speed, direction and seemed to hover at times. there was no noise, they were just lit like stars.',\n",

       "  'description': 'six orange lights fly over Santa Cruz, CAAt approximately 9:05 PM on Saturday, May 1st 2010, at my home (of twelve years) located on 38th Ave. in Santa Cruz, CA. United States I observed the following; I was sitting on the couch in the living room when I heard my wife yelling&rsquo; &ldquo;babe you gotta see this&rdquo;, I ran to the side porch and observed two large orange lights that seemed to be floating upwards. My view was obstructed by a tree in my side yard so I ran with my wife to the street where I observed a total of six (6) round, bright orange lights that seemed to be at a very low altitude coming from the North and gaining altitude slowly as they headed south.They seemed to follow each other in more of a floating manner like a balloon, than that of a helicopter or other aircraft. The objects made no sound. I do not believe these objects were balloons because of their size which on a pretty clear night seamed huge. From my perspective they appeared to be about a half a mile away at their closest (about a minute after we first spotted them). And again, (from my perspective) they appeared to be the size of a bus or larger only round and bright orange. I called my daughter and her boyfriend outside with her phone to try and get video but was unable, they also saw the object&rsquo;s towards the end of the incident.From beginning to end, we probably only observed the object&rsquo;s for maybe two minutes, but I will never forget those two minutes. As the objects floated upwards they disappeared into high clouds, we also observed some type of aircraft flying towards the object&rsquo;s as they disappeared.A passer by walked up and said, &ldquo;Did you just see that, what was it!&rdquo; we all went inside and expected to see &ldquo;the lights&rdquo;, all over the news and internet, but can&rsquo;t find anything?? Still looking!',\n",
