# The Iron Yard Durham - Python - Cohort 6

Welcome to the Python class at The Iron Yard in Durham! We are going to have an amazing semester. You're going to need to do a few things to get ready before we start class:

* [Get and setup your Mac](mac.md)
* [Read through the syllabus](syllabus.md)
* [Complete your prework](prework.md)

The prework will take you quite some time -- probably around 40 hours -- so don't wait until the last minute to start it. It is due one week before class begins.
